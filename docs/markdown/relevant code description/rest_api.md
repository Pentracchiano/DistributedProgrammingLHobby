# Rest API
In this section, interesting parts of the REST code will be explored and commented. 

## Models

	Here, only code will be described: for the architecture, head to [the database reference](../architecture/index.md#Database).
### Operating on users in OngoingMatch
In the `rest_api_ongoingmatch` table, information about the currently playing users is not easily accessible. Furthermore, inserting and removing users consists of two operations, requiring both a change of role and of the `ongoing_match` foreign key of the user.

Rather than repeating often-used queries, Python's computed properties were used in order to simulate having hosts, challengers and spectators readily available and modifiable directly in the `#!python OngoingMatch` instance.
This helped to reduce the verbosity of the code, to respect the _Don't repeat yourself (DRY)_ principle and, more importantly, to avoid to forget to change both attributes in the user.

```python linenums="71"
    @property
    def host(self) -> typing.Optional[User]:
        try:
            return self.user_set.get(role=User.Role.HOST)
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return None

    @host.setter
    def host(self, value: User):
        if self.host:
            raise ValueError('Host was already set')

        if value.ongoing_match:
            raise ValueError(f'User {value.username} is already in a match')

        value.ongoing_match = self
        value.role = User.Role.HOST
        value.save(update_fields=['role', 'ongoing_match'])
```

This snippet enables the use of simple syntax for accessing or setting the host of a match as if it were an attribute of the class:

```python
user = User.objects.get(username='msilla')
ongoing_match.host = user

print(ongoing_match.host)
>>> User(<msilla>)
```

The setter property also validates the inserting operation, raising `#!python ValueError` if incompatibilites arise.
Code equivalents exist for the challenger and spectator roles, with the only exception being the spectator methods permitting multiple players with the same role.

### Ending a match 
In order to complete a match correctly, it is needed to:

- update the players' ELOs;
- set the role and the `ongoing_match` of the players to `#!python None`;
- delete the current `OngoingMatch` instance from the database;
- create a corresponding `CompletedMatch` instance to keep track of the
games history.

It is very important to conduct all of these operations in a single database
 transaction, in order to avoid leaving the data in an inconsistent state â€” either for brief durations while *during* the execution, or until human intervention if any errors happen before completing the set of needed operations.

This is only one example of such a situation, which demonstrates the use
 of transactions in the Django Model API.

!!!important
     In the following snippet, the `ongoing_match` foreign key is not updated because it is automatically set to `#!sql NULL` by the DBMS due to the configured `on_delete` policy.

```python linenums="157"
    def complete_match(self, winner: User, loser: User, winner_score: int, loser_score: int) -> CompletedMatch:
        users = [self.host, self.challenger]
        if winner.username == loser.username:
            raise ValueError('Winner and Loser must be different')
        if (winner not in users) or (loser not in users):
            raise ValueError('User not playing the game')

        new_winner_elo, new_loser_elo = compute_elos(winner, loser, winner_score, loser_score)

        with transaction.atomic():
            completed_match = CompletedMatch.objects.create(
                winner=winner,
                loser=loser,
                start_timestamp=self.start_timestamp,
                winner_score=winner_score,
                loser_score=loser_score,
                winner_elo_before_match=winner.elo,
                loser_elo_before_match=loser.elo,
                winner_elo_after_match=new_winner_elo,
                loser_elo_after_match=new_loser_elo
            )

            winner.elo = new_winner_elo
            loser.elo = new_loser_elo

            winner.role = None
            loser.role = None

            winner.save(update_fields=['elo', 'role'])
            loser.save(update_fields=['elo', 'role'])

            self.delete()

        return completed_match
```
