The platforms keeps track of users past matches and progress, allowing competition among players.

It is possible to create or join a match as player or spectator, and after the game check the platform-wide leaderboard.

Since the platform makes use of language agnostic protocols, it is possible to link _cross-platform_ clients to it.
